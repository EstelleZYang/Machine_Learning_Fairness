    "Today we are going to explore the methods of unfairness problem in Machine Learning. Since Propublica organization pointed out that the COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanction) system which is a database containing the criminal history are discrminatory against race and gender.It's analysis shows that Black defandants were often predicted to be at a higher risk of recidivism than they actually were while white defandants were predicted to be less risky. Recidivism is defined as defandants reoffend and get arrested again within two years. And the risk scores evaluated by their systemun results in unfairness between the defandant's recidivism situation. \n"

    "Here we introduce Learning Fair Representations techiniques to solve unfairness problem, the learning algorithm for fair classification is achieved by formulating fairness as optimization problem of finding good representation. The main idea in this model is to map each individual, represented as a data point in a given input space, to a probability distribution in a new representation space. General speaking, the goal of our model is to learn a good prototype set with the consideration of accuracy and statiscal parity.\n",
