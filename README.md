Term: Fall 2021

+ Team # 1
+ Project title: Learning fair representations (LFR) vs Fairness Beyond Disparate Treatment & Disparate Impact: Learning Classification without Disparate Mistreatment (DM and DM-sen)
+ Team members
	+ Bischoff, Melissa
	+ Jennings-Dobbs, Emily
	+ Nie, Jiayi
	+ Wang, Wanxin

	+ Zhao, Yang
+ Project summary: In this project we implement, evaluate, and compare algorithms for ML Fairness. Specifically, we correct the unfairness associated with the COMPAS risk score utilizing the Learning Fair Representation (LFR), and Learning Classification without Disparate Mistreatment (DM & DM-sen) algorithms.
	
**Contribution statement**: Wanxin Wang, Melissa Bischoff, and Emily Jennings-Dobbs implemented the LFR algorithm. Rodrigo Zarate, Yang Zhao, and Jiayi Nie implemented the DM & DM-sen algorithms, debugging of both implementations was attempted by all group members with notable contributions from Wanxin Wang and Rodrigo Zarate. All team members were involved in the evaluation and comparison of the different algorithms. Yang Zhao presented the project. All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement.
