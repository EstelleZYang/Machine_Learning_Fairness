# Project 4: Machine Learning Fairness

### [Project Description](doc/project4_desc.md)

Please see [doc/main.pdf](doc/main.pdf) for the final report. See [lib/](lib/) for code algorithm implementation.

Term: Fall 2021

+ Team # 1
+ Project title: Learning fair representations (LFR) vs Fairness Beyond Disparate Treatment & Disparate Impact: Learning Classification without Disparate Mistreatment (DM and DM-sen)
+ Team members
	+ Bischoff, Melissa
	+ Jennings-Dobbs, Emily
	+ Nie, Jiayi
	+ Wang, Wanxin
	+ Zarate, Rodrigo
	+ Zhao, Yang
+ Project summary: In this project we implement, evaluate, and compare algorithms for ML Fairness. Specifically, we correct the unfairness associated with the COMPAS risk score utilizing the Learning Fair Representation (LFR), and Learning Classification without Disparate Mistreatment (DM & DM-sen) algorithms.
	
**Contribution statement**: For the initial implementation of the models, the group was split into 2 teams. Wanxin Wang, Melissa Bischoff, and Emily Jennings-Dobbs were responsible for the LFR algorithm. Emily and Melissa primarily did research and debugging while Wanxin wrote and comitted the initial version of the algorithm. Rodrigo Zarate, Yang Zhao, and Jiayi Nie were responsible for the DM & DM-sen algorithms. Rodrigo researched and drew up an explanation of the algorithm while Yang wrote and debugged the code. All team members were involved in the evaluation and comparison of the different algorithms. Yang Zhao presented the project. All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement.
